Problem solving can’t always be done alone. In fact, collaborating and receiving help from others is oftentimes the more efficient way to find a solution. Basically, getting help is integral to the learning process, especially when it comes to developing your software engineering skills. We’ve all heard the phrase, “don’t be afraid to ask questions”  before, and while no one should ever hesitate to do just that, it’s important to know exactly how to ask and form questions. 

StackOverflow is a help forum well-known by novice and expert programmers alike. When googling a programming question, StackOverflow is frequently listed amongst the first five links. A brief browsing of the website reveals a wide range in the quality of questions and answers. Some answers come in the form of irritable replies such as, “do your own homework”, which could deter many first-time posters. On closer inspection, these short and low-effort answers are usually in reply to questions that lack the same amount of thought. Situations like this leaves everyone unhappy and, more importantly, nothing is solved. Therefore, knowing how to ask a good question is integral to receiving the best answer. 

The article “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” by software developer Eric S. Raymond outlines multiple ways on how to construct an effective question. From the nearly 11k words in Raymond’s article, I’ve gathered that when asking a question, it’s crucial to: 1) Not be lazy and 2) Be precise. 


BAD QUESTION 


Judging by the downvotes, it’s clear that people were less than impressed with this posting. But why? In his article, Raymond stresses how important it is to do your own research before asking. If the asker doesn’t show that they put at least some effort into solving their problem on their own, others will be less willing to help out. The question above shows minimal effort; the problem is briefly described and followed by a quick copy-paste of the output. Immediately you’re left with an impression that the asker is lazy.
