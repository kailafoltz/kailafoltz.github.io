## Doing it the hard way
Let’s make some good old garlic bread. Simple right? Ok, well what if I said we’re going to make this dish in 15 minutes, entirely from scratch, and I mean ENTIRELY. Yes, the butter is nothing but cream at the moment, the bread is just some yeast and we’re going to have to go out and dig up some garlic from the dirt. Now this simple task has become a lot more complicated. It’s time-consuming and entirely unnecessary when we already have these ingredients pre-made for us at a grocery store. To make everything easier, why don’t we just use some store-bought bread, butter, and garlic.

## Design
The store-bought bread, butter and garlic are our design patterns. People have been making and growing these foods for years. They have the process down. Why do we have to make it all ourselves? Design patterns are ready-made solutions or guidelines we can implement in our code to solve common design problems.
