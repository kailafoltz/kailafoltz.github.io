## Simple things, the hard way
Let’s make some good old garlic bread. Simple right? Ok, well what if I said we’re going to make this dish in 15 minutes, entirely from scratch, and I mean ENTIRELY. Yes, the butter is nothing but cream at the moment, the bread is just some yeast and we’re going to have to go out and dig up some garlic from the dirt. Now this simple task has become a lot more complicated. It’s time-consuming and entirely unnecessary when we already have these ingredients pre-made for us at a grocery store. To make everything easier, why don’t we just use some store-bought bread, butter, and garlic. 


## Life doesn't have to be so hard

Judging by the downvotes, it’s clear that people were less than impressed with this posting. But why? In his article, Raymond stresses how important it is to do your own research before asking. If the asker doesn’t show that they put at least some effort into solving their problem on their own, others will be less willing to help out. The question above shows minimal effort; the problem is briefly described and followed by a quick copy-paste of the output. Immediately you’re left with an impression that the asker is lazy.
