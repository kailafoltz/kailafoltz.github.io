## Doing it the hard way

Let’s make some good old garlic bread. Simple right? Ok, well what if I said we’re going to make this dish in 15 minutes, entirely from scratch, and I mean ENTIRELY. Yes, the butter is nothing but cream at the moment, the bread is just some yeast and we’re going to have to go out and dig up some garlic from the dirt. Now this simple task has become a lot more complicated. It’s time-consuming and entirely unnecessary when we already have these ingredients pre-made for us at a grocery store. To make everything easier, why don’t we just use some store-bought bread, butter, and garlic. 

## Life doesn't have to be so hard 
The store-bought bread, butter and garlic are our design patterns. People have been making and growing these foods for years. They have the process down. Why do we have to make it all ourselves? Design patterns are ready-made solutions or guidelines we can implement in our code to solve common design problems. Want to make some whipped cream? Instead of spending 30 minutes furiously mixing your cream with a fork, why not use a whisk? The whisk was **made** for this exact situation. 

## Not the answer to all your problems

Like everything else in programming, design patterns aren't the solutions to everything. Design patterns are **guidelines**, not rules set in stone. Sometimes a design pattern will only make code unnecessarily complex. Let's say you were asked to make a couple basic round pancakes. For some odd reason, the only recipe that you have on making pancakes lists a darth-vader pancake maker as one of the tools you'll need. You don't need to figure out a work-around the darth vader shape to somehow get basic round pancakes out of it. Just use a pan.
