Until the end of my first year of college, I had no clear idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I would always find a new hobby, then subsequently lose interest in it over time. The only constant I've had throughout the years is a burning desire to create, and learning how to program gave me the tools to do just that.

At the beginning of my college career, my desire to create drove me to pursue film and art. Although I enjoyed the subject, I never felt the thrill that usually came with learning new material. By the time my second semester of college came around, I stumbled upon an internet course in java programming and immediately fell in love with the challenges it presented. I went from printing "Hello World" to a screen, to writing a program that calculated the first one hundred Fibonacci numbers in just a few hours. I was hooked. Suddenly I knew what I wanted to do in college and my career, and I haven't looked back since.

The field of computer science is a gold-mine for those who want to make things; its countless subfields, such as deep learning, are constantly expanding and the things you can accomplish through it start to seem limitless. As I've barely scratched the surface of CS, I hope to learn a lot through the ICS 314 Software Engineering course I'm taking this semester.
