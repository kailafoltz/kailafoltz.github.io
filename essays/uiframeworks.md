## Why use a UI Framework?
When I first tried creating a website using HTML and CSS alone, I was horrified by how 2003 it looked. How can a simple webpage need such a lengthy stylesheet? Despite spending a lot of time adding as many styles as I could to my css file, all I could think about when looking at my webpage was that 'graphic design is my passion' meme. There was no way I could make an appealing and responsive website in a decent amount of time without a UI framework. Having never used a UI framework, I was nervous about the undoubtedly extensive amount of rules and info I would have to learn before implementing it in class. To my surprise the UI framework I used, Semantic UI, was incredibly intuitive and easy to grasp. 


Judging by the downvotes, it’s clear that people were less than impressed with this posting. But why? In his article, Raymond stresses how important it is to do your own research before asking. If the asker doesn’t show that they put at least some effort into solving their problem on their own, others will be less willing to help out. The question above shows minimal effort; the problem is briefly described and followed by a quick copy-paste of the output. Immediately you’re left with an impression that the asker is lazy.
