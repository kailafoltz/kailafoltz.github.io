## Why use Semantic UI?
When I first tried creating a website using HTML and CSS alone, I was horrified by how 2003 it looked. Why does a simple webpage need such a lengthy stylesheet? Despite spending a lot of time on my css file, all I could think about when looking at my webpage was that 'graphic design is my passion' meme. <img class="ui right floated small image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/graphicdes.jpg"> There was no way I could make an appealing and responsive website in a decent amount of time without a UI framework. Having never used a UI framework, I was nervous about the undoubtedly extensive amount of rules and info I would have to learn before implementing it in class. To my surprise the framework I used, Semantic UI, was incredibly intuitive and easy to grasp. 

## Know how to use nouns and adjectives? You're all set.
Want a spinning loading icon? With Semantic UI, just stick the words "spinner loading icon" into an <i> tag and VOILA! You've got a loading icon on your webpage. In the first section of this essay, I have a small image that's floats to the right of the page. How'd I do that? All I did was add the "ui right floated small image" class to the 'img' tag and now it's exactly how I want it. No more having to figure out what random strings of words you need to format an element <i>just</i> right.
