## Why use Semantic UI?
When I first tried creating a website using HTML and CSS alone, I was horrified by how 2003 it looked. Why does a simple webpage need such a lengthy stylesheet? Despite spending a lot of time on my css file, all I could think about when looking at my webpage was that 'graphic design is my passion' meme. <img class="ui right floated small image" style="margin-top: 5px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/graphicdes.jpg"> There was no way I could make an appealing and responsive website in a decent amount of time without a UI framework. Having never used a one, I was nervous about the undoubtedly extensive amount of rules and info I would have to learn before implementing it in class. To my surprise the framework I used, Semantic UI, was incredibly intuitive and easy to grasp. 

## Know how to use nouns and adjectives? You're all set.
Want a spinning loading icon? With Semantic UI, just stick the words "spinner loading icon" into an 'i' tag and VOILA! You've got yourself a handy-dandy loading icon on your webpage. In the first section of this essay, I have a small image that's floats to the right of the page. How'd I do that? All I did was add the "ui right floated small image" class to the 'img' tag and now it's exactly how I want it. No more having to figure out what random strings of words you need to use in order format an element <i>just</i> right. If you're familiar with the basics of English language, getting started with Semantic UI is no sweat. 


## Conclusion
UI frameworks makes a web developer's life easier. Period. You won't need a 3-mile long stylesheet to create a beautiful and modern website. Of course it's not the be all end all tool of creating websites if you want full control; a UI framework might not be customizable enough for some people. But if you're working with strict deadlines or just want to get a design idea out there, a framework can speed up your process ten-fold.
