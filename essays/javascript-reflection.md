When I first began my journey into programming, I foolishly believed that Java and Javascript were one in the same. Boy, was I wrong. Through a simple Google search I came across the quote, "Java and Javascript are similar like Car and Carpet are similar". Prior to taking ICS 314, I only had experience with Java, C, C++ and Python, so this is my first go at using an interpreted language. I've seen the never-ending complaints and jokes made about Javascript by people on the web; it's too slow, not secure, lacks control etc. But in my limited, one-week experience with the language, I have no qualms with the language and find it incredibly user-friendly so far.
