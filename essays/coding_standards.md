I wasn’t thrilled when I first started using ESLint. It felt like I was back in a middle school math class where the teacher would take off points merely for the fact that my answer wasn’t labeled. “But it’s correct!”, I’d grumble. Same thing for linting my code. Missed something as trivial as a space before an opening brace? It’s an error! The code still works great, so WHY do I have to change it? After using it for a second time, I realized that linting my code was actually more helpful than it was a nuisance. 

Much like using a lint roller on a black shirt covered in cat hair, a code linter removes all the ‘ugly’ from your program. ESLint detects a plethora of bugs, ranging anywhere from minor to disastrous. Scope issue? Not in ESLint’s house. Moreover, linting your code vastly improves the readability of it. Imagine working in a group project where everyone’s coding preferences were different; now you have to spend even more time trying to read and comprehend what everyone else wrote.
