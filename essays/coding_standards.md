I wasn’t thrilled when I first started using ESLint. It felt like I was back in a middle school math class where the teacher would take off points merely for the fact that my answer wasn’t labeled. “But it’s correct!”, I’d grumble. Same thing for linting my code. Missed something as trivial as a space before an opening brace? It’s an error! The code still works great, so WHY do I have to change it? After using it a second time, I realized that linting was actually more helpful than it was a nuisance. 

Much like using a lint roller on a black t-shirt covered in cat hair, a code linter removes all the ‘ugly’ from your program. ESLint detects a plethora of bugs, ranging anywhere from minor to disastrous. Scope conflict? Not in ESLint’s house. Moreover, linting your code vastly improves the readability of it. Much like artists, many programmers start to develop their own style once they get the hang of a language. In time, everyone’s style becomes unique enough to elicit a few ‘wtf’s when you look through it. Imagine working in a group project where everyone’s coding preferences were different; now you have to spend even more time trying to read and comprehend what everyone else wrote. Basically: nice, clean, well-structured code looks good and makes collaborating less painful.

Alongside grey hoodies, a good code linter is another item to add to the software engineer’s toolbox. It detects syntax errors that even the most vigilant programmers might overlook, and establishes a universal structure for a language. After only two days, I learned to love ESLint. Those annoying red squiggly lines have imbued in me better habits, and improved my overall skills in programming.
