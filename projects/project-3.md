Egg Run was my first go at creating a 2-D platformer. It is a game about an egg named Marshmellow, who jumps onto different platforms to navigate its way through various obstable courses. Through this project, I learned how to implement sprite sheets and create animations using python and pygame. I also learned rudimentary elements of game design, such as level design.
